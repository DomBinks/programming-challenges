# programming-challenges

I am currently working through the book 
Programming Challenges by Steven Skiena and Miguel Revilla.

This repository contains my solutions to the problems presented in this book.

There are probably more elegant solutions to the ones I've used. Eventually I may go back and try and improve my solutions.
